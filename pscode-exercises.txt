// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(Your pseudocode here)
give 2 numbers of 1-10
add 2 numbers together
print sum of 2 numbers
let know if numbers odd or even

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)
call numbers 1-5 differently
add numbers and divide by 5
locate smallest number by averaging total
locate largest number by averaging total
print results of average and smallest and largest numbers
